This is a repository of containers designed for usage with Toolbox/Distrobox. They are updated regularly, meaning that pulling them down and running them should require very few package updates within the container at the start.

## Images

- `arch-toolbox` - an Arch Linux base image with all of the necessary packages for distrobox to function fully with it out of the box.
- `arch-libvirt` - an Arch Linux image with libvirtd and virt-manager pre-installed. A perfect container to run virtual machines inside of.
- `arch-gaming` - an Arch Linux image with steam, lutris, gamescope, and various other gaming utilities pre-installed. A perfect container to play video games with.
